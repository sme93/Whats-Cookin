## Overview and Project Goals
Rosemary & Sage is an application built in week 8 of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).  The goal of this paired [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/whats-cookin.html) was to build an application where users can view a collection of recipes, search for recipe by name, tag, and ingredient, and add favorites or recipes to cook.

### Learning Goals
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- Creating a robust testing suite using TDD
- Using ES6 syntax to create and interact with JavaScript classes
- Utilizing object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Implementing responsive layout
- Making network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data


## Functionality

- Upon opening the application, user is greeted and will see all recipes displayed. User may click on any recipe for more details such as instructions, ingredients, and cost of ingredients:

- User is able to add a recipe to favorites or to a list or recipes to cook, either on the detailed recipe section, or on the main page.  User may then click on *My Favorite Recipes* or *My Recipes to Cook* to view their saved recipes:
![Favorite/To Cook](src/assets/Favorite.gif)

- User may also search for a recipe by name or by ingredient. They may also filter by recipe type and can clear these filters to see all recipes displayed:
![Search/Filter](src/assets/search_filter.gif)


## Future Additions
- *User login* functionality to save favorite recipes to local storage
- *User Pantry* functionality to determine whether a user's pantry has enough ingredients to cook a recipe or what they need to add to their grocery list
- *Create a Recipe* form for user to create their own recipe and save it to the list of recipes
- *Share Recipe* option to share a recipe to social media or email to a friend
